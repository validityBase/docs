vBase stores digital fingerprints of data, metadata, and revisions on public blockchains, offering key advantages over traditional data verification methods:

1. vBase is **Privacy-Preserving** – vBase builds and verifies provenance without accessing the underlying data.

Traditional data verification often requires one to grant 3rd parties access to data. For example, this is how an auditor works, or how many regulators work, and how other 3rd party "trusted" services work. The trust model in these cases is "we've seen the data, and you can trust us, so you can trust that the data is valid". 

In the vBase model, you can make your data's timeliness and authenticity permanently verifiable, while sharing it with no-one.

vBase creates verifiable authenticity and timeliness information about data by publishing a fingerprint of the data to a public blockchain. Because vBase uses data fingerprints to identify data, we NEVER need to see the underlying data to enable validation.

This can be highly advantageous in cases where data is sensitive for reasons of privacy, security, or intellectual property protection. 


2. Resilient – Provenance can continue to be built and verified even if validityBase ceases to exist. No centralized intermediaries means no single point of failure.
3. Auditable – Third-party tools can independently verify vBase data provenance claims.
4. Protocol-Based – Like TCP/IP, vBase ensures long-term interoperability without the risk of unilateral changes.
5. Future-Proof – Data provenance remains verifiable for decades or longer.
