# Example Use Cases for vBase Tools

vBase is a tool built for anyone who needs to prove *what they knew, and when they knew it*. 

vBase allows anyone to build data for which it can be proven that the dataset is complete, timely and free from selective presentation. 

vBase is domain-agnostic: any dataset or model that can be represented as a file or standard binary can be stamped and verified.  

Many users apply vBase tools in finance, where data credibility and timing are critical. The examples below illustrate how vBase supports both financial and non-financial applications.

## Finance

Verifiable data provenance is particularly valuable in finance, where data loses credibility if timestamps or revision history are unknown. 
To demonstrate investment skill or dataset quality, recipients must be sure they are seeing a **complete, and timely record that is free from selective presentation.**

vBase helps resolve several persistent inefficiencies in how financial data is marketed, evaluated, and consumed. 

### Alternative Data Providers
Stamp daily or minute-by-minute data (e.g., sentiment scores, developer activity, employment aggregates, transit movements).  
These stamps prove that a dataset is **point-in-time, complete, and free from selective presentation**, allowing investors to confirm what data they would have received historically, and backtest reliably.

### Quant Researchers & Model Builders
Stamp each **portfolio weights file** or signal output at every rebalance to form a **verifiable performance history.**  
This ensures backtests, factors, and signals were not retrofitted, revised, or selectively presented. Use vBase to turn any trading signal into a live verifiable index. 

### Investment Managers
Build a verified record for fund sleeves, SMAs, model portfolios, and derivatives strategies to support compliant marketing.  
Investors can independently verify that performance dashboards and disclosures reflect authentic, point-in-time portfolio and trade records.

### Fundamental Analysts
Stamp research models, valuation frameworks, and investment write-ups.  
This documents **when investment ideas were presented** and proves that trade recommendations and models were made without hindsight or retroactive revisions.

### Index Providers & Calculation Agents
Stamp **portfolio weights, constituent files, and methodologies** at every rebalance.  
This creates an **immutable audit trail** of index composition, rules, and lineage — providing transparency to clients, partners, and regulators.

### Time-Series & Forecasting Models
Maintain a verifiable record of **predictions, revisions, and other outputs** to build an auditable model performance history. 
Each forecast is independently timestamped, creating a provable record of model performance.

### Backtest Verification
Stamp **backtest results and configurations** to show when a backtest was executed, with what parameters, and how many variations were tested.  
This allows backtests to run verifiably out-of-sample from that point forward and lets third parties confirm authenticity.

### Survey Data Providers
Stamp **raw survey responses and aggregated results** to ensure the dataset is authentically point-in-time.  
This removes doubts about survivorship bias, selective exclusion, or retroactive data manipulation.

### Auditable Recordkeeping
Stamp monthly **risk, compliance, valuation, or client reports** to preserve a verifiable, time-stamped record of what was known and disclosed at the time — creating a tamper-proof audit trail for internal, regulatory, or client verification.

## Non-Finance

The same need for credible provenance extends beyond finance.  
Any field where data, models, or content evolve over time benefits from anchoring datasets to publicly verifiable timestamps.

### AI & Machine Learning
Stamp each batch of model predictions, training runs, or evaluation outputs to create a **timestamped, verifiable record of model behavior and performance.**  
This supports accountability and auditability for autonomous or “agentic” AI systems.

### Research Institutions & Academia
Register papers, datasets, or experimental results to **establish authorship, verify inputs, and protect intellectual property.**  
vBase supports reproducibility, transparent collaboration, and open research validation.

### Media & Information Publishers
Prove the **authenticity and publication time** of original content.  
This builds audience trust and combats misinformation by showing when and by whom information was first published.

### Legal & Compliance Teams
Anchor **contracts, reports, and evidence files** to create **tamper-proof document audit trails.**  
This provides verifiable assurance during audits, disclosures, or legal proceedings.

### Supply Chain & ESG Data Providers
Stamp updates to **traceability and sustainability datasets** to prove authenticity and timing.  
This demonstrates transparent provenance and accountability across complex supply chains.

### Government & Public Agencies
Preserve **auditable records of datasets, forecasts, and policy updates** to improve accountability and public trust.  
Blockchain anchoring ensures official communications remain verifiable and historically recoverable.

### Project Deliverables & Client Workflows
Stamp each **milestone, deliverable, or dataset** at hand-off to create an immutable record of what was provided and when.  
This offers clients and partners a shared, verifiable timeline of work products.


## Summary

In any context where the question **“What did you know, and when?”** matters, vBase provides a cryptographic, independently verifiable answer — transforming credibility into a verifiable standard.
