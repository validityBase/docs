# Example Use Cases for vBase Tools

vBase is built for anyone who needs to prove **what they knew — and when they knew it.**

It allows users to build data assets that are **complete, timely, and free from selective presentation.**  
Because vBase is domain-agnostic, any dataset or model that can be represented as a file or binary object can be stamped and verified.

Many users apply vBase in **finance**, where data credibility and timing are critical, but the same principles readily extend outside finance.  
The examples below illustrate how vBase supports both **financial** and **non-financial** applications.



## Finance

Verifiable data provenance is especially valuable in finance, where credibility disappears when timestamps or revision histories are unclear.  
To demonstrate investment skill or dataset quality, recipients must see a **complete and timely record that is free from selective presentation.**

vBase resolves long-standing inefficiencies in how financial data is **marketed, evaluated, and consumed.**

### Alternative Data Providers
Stamp daily or minute-by-minute data — such as sentiment scores, developer activity, employment aggregates, or transit movements.  
A Collection of stamps proves the dataset is **point-in-time, complete, and free from selective presentation**, enabling investors to confirm what data they would have historically received and to backtest historical data with confidence.

### Quant Researchers & Model Builders
Stamp each **portfolio weights file** or signal output at every rebalance to form a **verifiable performance history.**  
This ensures backtests, factors, and signals are not retrofitted, revised, or selectively presented — turning any trading signal into a live, verifiable index.

### Investment Managers
Build a **verified record** for fund sleeves, SMAs, model portfolios, and derivatives strategies to support compliant marketing.  
Investors can independently confirm that dashboards and disclosures reflect authentic, point-in-time portfolio and trade records.

### Fundamental Analysts
Stamp research models, valuation frameworks, and investment write-ups to document **when ideas were generated** and ensure they weren’t revised with hindsight.  
This proves recommendations and models are being presented as published. 

### Index Providers & Calculation Agents
Stamp **portfolio weights, constituent files, and methodologies** at every rebalance to create an **immutable audit trail** of index composition, rules, and lineage — delivering transparency to clients, partners, and regulators.

### Time-Series & Forecasting Models
Maintain a verifiable record of **predictions, revisions, and other model outputs** to build an auditable performance history.  
Each forecast is independently timestamped, creating a provable record of model behavior over time.

### Backtest Verification
Stamp **backtest results and configurations** to show when a backtest was executed, with what parameters, and how many variations were tested.  
This allows backtests to run verifiably *out-of-sample* from that point forward and lets third parties confirm authenticity.

### Survey Data Providers
Stamp **raw responses and aggregated results** to verify that datasets are authentically point-in-time.  
This removes doubts about survivorship bias, selective exclusion, or retroactive adjustments.

### Auditable Recordkeeping
Stamp monthly **risk, compliance, valuation, or client reports** to preserve a **tamper-proof, time-stamped audit trail** of what was known and disclosed at the time — useful for internal, regulatory, and client verification.



## Non-Finance

The same need for credible provenance extends far beyond finance.  
Any field where data, models, or content evolve over time can benefit from anchoring datasets to publicly verifiable timestamps.

### AI & Machine Learning
Stamp each batch of **model predictions, training runs, or evaluation outputs** to create a **timestamped, verifiable record of model behavior.**  
This supports accountability, auditability, and reproducibility for autonomous or agentic AI systems.

### Research Institutions & Academia
Register **papers, datasets, or experimental results** to establish **authorship, verify inputs, and protect intellectual property.**  
vBase promotes reproducibility, transparent collaboration, and open research validation.

### Media & Information Publishers
Prove the **authenticity and publication time** of original content to build audience trust and combat misinformation.  
Readers can see exactly *when* and *by whom* information was first published.

### Legal & Compliance Teams
Anchor **contracts, reports, and evidence files** to create **tamper-proof document audit trails.**  
This provides verifiable assurance during audits, disclosures, and legal proceedings.

### Supply Chain & ESG Data Providers
Stamp **traceability and sustainability updates** to prove authenticity and timing.  
This demonstrates transparent provenance and accountability across complex supply chains.

### Government & Public Agencies
Preserve **auditable records of datasets, forecasts, and policy updates** to improve accountability and public trust.  
Blockchain anchoring ensures official communications remain verifiable and historically recoverable.

### Project Deliverables & Client Workflows
Stamp each **milestone, deliverable, or dataset** at hand-off to create an **immutable record of delivery.**  
This gives clients and partners a shared, verifiable timeline of progress and deliverables.



## Summary

In any context where the question **“What did you know, and when?”** matters,  
vBase provides a cryptographic, independently verifiable answer — transforming credibility into an automated feature of your data.
