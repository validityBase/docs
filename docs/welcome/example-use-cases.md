## Basic Example

If you want to prove when you created invention.pdf, vBase Stamping the file generates a unique fingerprint of the file and records this fingerprint on a public blockchain, creating a verifiable, permanent timestamp for the file signed by your blockchain identity.

This timestamp can be independently verified at any time simply by re-calculating the fingerprint of invention.pdf and checking when this fingerprint was published to the blockchain. 

NOTE: invention.pdf is never shared as part of the stamping process, it remains local on your computer until you wish to share it for verification. 


## Expanded Example 

Imagine you generate a new CSV file daily that records all stock trades executed by your algorithm. Each day, after the trades are finalized, you vBase Stamp the CSV file, creating a unique fingerprint of each day's CSV and recording it on the blockchain. You assign each CSV to a Collection called "My Winning Strategy"

Over time, this process builds a verifiable track record of your trading strategy. Anyone can later audit the performance of "My Winning Strategy" by checking the sequence of timestamps and verifying that no historical CSVs were modified, no trades have been added and no trades are missing&mdash; ensuring transparency and integrity. 

vBase also makes verifiable whether you ran 100 other strategies or only "My Winning Strategy". 

All this can be verified independently of vBase by comparing the public blockchain records to the data, vBase simply provides an easy-to-use robust interface for executing the verification process.
