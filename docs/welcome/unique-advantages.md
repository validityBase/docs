vBase stores digital fingerprints of data, metadata, and revisions on public blockchains, offering key advantages over traditional data verification methods:

## vBase is Privacy-Preserving

vBase builds and verifies provenance without accessing the underlying data.

Traditional data verification often requires one to grant 3rd parties access to data. For example, you share your data with an administrator, an auditor a regulator, a certification body, or some other 3rd party "trusted" service. The trust model in these cases is "we've seen the data, and you can trust us, so if we say the data is valid, you can trust us." 

In the vBase model, you can make your data's timeliness and authenticity permanently verifiable, while sharing it with no-one. Because vBase uses data fingerprints to identify data, we NEVER need to see the underlying data to enable validation. For more details, read [How vBase Works](how-vbase-works.md)

This is highly advantageous when data is sensitive for reasons of privacy, security, or intellectual property protection. 


## vBase is Highly Resilient 

Even if validityBase disappears, the protocols it uses will still function because it's setup to be a set of openly published rules that does not rely on a single company or server to build or verify data provenance - see [Technical Overview](technical-overview.md)). This makes vBase more trustworthy, durable, and fail-proof than even the most established companies offering similar services.

You can build your reputation without fear of losing it due to the loss of a single business relationship. Your critical verification data can continue to be built and validated even if validityBase were to stop offering service. 

Provenance can continue to be built and verified even if validityBase ceases to exist. No centralized intermediaries means no single point of failure.


## vBase Claims are Independently Verifiable

Since vBase provenance claims are built on data fingerprints that sit on public blockchains, a verifier with basic technical skills can indpendently confirm the provenance of your data for themselves. While vBase provides a convenient set of tools and interfaces for this process, a verifier who wishes to check vBase claims for themselves can always do so. 

Unlike with a trusted 3rd party model, one need not trust vBase to confirm the provenance of your data. Third-party tools can independently verify vBase data provenance claims.


## vBase Architecture Assures Long-term Interoperability 

vBase is protocol-based, ike TCP/IP. The underlying vBase verification fingeprint data is publicly available. This means you can develop integrated views, workflows, and solutions leveraging your provenance data, with confidence that they will remain interoperable and function reliably over time. 

Even if vBase wanted to, we could not deny you access to your own data. This assures long-term interoperability without the risk of unilateral changes.


## vBase Data Provenance is Future-Proof

Thanks to the way in which blockchains are constructed, older blocks of data are even more reliable and trustworthy than those that have been recently added. This means that as your data provenance fingerprints age, they become even more trustworthy than the day they were created. 

Even if the underlying blockchain were to cease operations, as long as a single trustworthy copy of the chain history remains available, your data provenance can be verified. 

We expect data provenance built via vBase to remain verifiable for decades or longer.
