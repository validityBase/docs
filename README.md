# Welcome to vBase

vBase creates a globally verifiable record of when data was created, by whom, and how it has changed (collectively, “data provenance”). 

Data producers can use vBase to show the provenance of their data to any external party, increasing its value and marketability. Similarly, data consumers can verify the integrity and authenticity of 3rd party data, and any derivative calculations. 

The result? Trustworthy information that can be seamlessly shared and put into production quickly, without expensive and time-consuming trials.

With vBase, creating and consuming provably correct data is as easy as pressing a button.


## Use Cases in Finance

Verifiable data provenance is useful in many domains. For example, to demonstrate investment skill, the recipient of a track record must be sure they are seeing a complete, accurate and timely performance history. 

vBase resolves several expensive market failures common to financial data. Some of the areas that benefit include:

* Provably point-in-time datasets
* Institutionally credible low-cost investment track records
* Verifiable backtests and historical simulations
* Time-series models with verifiable prediction history


## Unique Advantages

vBase stores digital fingerprints of data, metadata, and revisions on public blockchains, offering key advantages over traditional verification methods:  

1. **Privacy-Preserving** – vBase builds and verifies provenance without accessing the underlying data.  
2. **Resilient** – Provenance can continue to be built and verified even if validityBase ceases to exist. No centralized intermediaries means no single point of failure.  
3. **Auditable** – Third-party tools can **independently verify** vBase data provenance claims.  
4. **Protocol-Based** – Like TCP/IP, vBase ensures long-term interoperability without the risk of unilateral changes.  
5. **Future-Proof** – Data provenance remains verifiable for decades or longer.


vBase is designed for ease of use, accessible via an intuititive [web application](https://app.vbase.com/) or via our user-friendly developer tools & SDKs (Python, C#, TypeScript, CLI).
