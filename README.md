# Welcome to vBase

vBase helps data providers, researchers, and investors **prove what they knew, when they knew it.**

By anchoring cryptographic fingerprints of datasets, portfolios, and research outputs to a public blockchain, vBase creates **independently verifiable, point-in-time records** that anyone can independently confirm — without revealing the underlying data.


## Why It Matters

In finance, data science and many other domains, the credibility of data depends on its timeliness, completeness and impartial presentation. vBase makes the timestamps and integrity of data provable — showing exactly what data, models, or results existed at each moment. This builds trust with clients, investors, and partners and enables credible communication about data in its various forms. 


## Use Cases

### Finance

Verifiable data provenance is useful in many areas of finance. For example, to demonstrate investment skill, the recipient of a track record must be sure they are seeing a complete, accurate, and timely trade history.  

vBase resolves several expensive market failures common to financial data. Some of the areas that benefit include:

* **Alternative data providers** who wish to build provably point-in-time datasets that investors can trust and easily trial.  
* **Quant researchers and model builders** who wish to prove that backtests, factors, and signal outputs were not retrofitted or selectively presented.  
* **Index providers and calculation agents** maintaining a cryptographically verifiable record of index weights and rebalances over time.  
* **Fund managers and allocators** preserving an immutable history of performance, holdings, and risk reports for compliance and marketing.  
* **Time-series and forecasting models** maintaining a verifiable record of predictions and revisions to demonstrate model consistency and accuracy.  


### Non-Finance

The same need for verifiable provenance extends far beyond finance. Any domain where predictive data and models are produced can benefit from stamping.

Examples include:

* **AI and machine learning teams** stamping model outputs to prove model effectiveness
* **Research institutions** registering papers, data releases, or experimental results to establish authorship and protect intellectual property.  
* **Media and information publishers** proving the authenticity and publication time of original content to combat misinformation.  
* **Legal and compliance teams** anchoring contracts, reports, or evidence files to create tamper-proof document trails.  
* **Supply chain and ESG data providers** demonstrating the provenance and authenticity of sustainability or traceability data.  
* **Government and public agencies** preserving auditable records of datasets, forecasts, and policy updates to increase public trust.  


In short, anywhere that “What did we know, and when?” is a meaningful question — vBase tools provide proof.
