# Welcome to vBase

vBase helps data providers, researchers, investors, and others prove **what they knew, when they knew it** or, put simply, **what data they had, and when they had it.**

By anchoring cryptographic fingerprints of datasets, portfolios, and research outputs to a public blockchain, vBase creates **globally credible, point-in-time records.** These records let others independently verify a dataset's timestamps, completeness and impartial presentation — all without revealing the underlying data.


## Why It Matters

In finance, data science, and other data-driven domains, data credibility depends on timeliness, completeness and impartial presentation. 

vBase makes these qualities provable — showing exactly what data, models, or results existed at each point-in-time. By turning **historical data integrity** into a verifiable fact, vBase helps communicate results with confidence and build lasting trust with clients, investors, and partners.


## What vBase Proves

Each **stamp** serves as cryptographic proof of **when** a specific digital object (usually a file) existed and which dataset, known as a **Collection** it belongs to.  

When organized as a **Collection**, multiple stamps together provide verifiable proof of:

- **Timestamp integrity** — the precise times at which data, files, or results within a dataset or strategy were created or updated.  
- **Dataset integrity** — that the files or data within a Collection have not been altered since those timestamps, and that no extra or missing data is being presented beyond what was stamped to the Collection. 
- **Impartial presentation** — that the dataset or trading strategy is not a selectively presented outlier among many parallel alternatives. vBase can verify how many datasets or models a user maintained at the time, making transparent the population from which any single dataset or strategy was drawn.

Together, these create a **globally credible, independently verifiable audit trail** for any dataset, model, or portfolio — showing exactly what data existed, and when.



## Use Cases

vBase is used by investment managers, data providers, model builders, AI platforms, quant researchers, and compliance teams — anywhere data credibility and timestamp verification matter.
